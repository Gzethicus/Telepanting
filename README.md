# Telepanting
A linear-time solution to the Telepanting problem

Original problem found at : https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1552/F.
Let n be the number of portals and m be the length of the track, the following is an algorithm that solves the Telepanting problem in O(m + n), which can be simplified to O(m) since m > 2n.
You might see a few operations being made modulo 998 244 353. This is part of the challenge's specifications and to prevent integer overflows.
